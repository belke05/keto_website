//NOTE registration info
hide "encryptedPassword" before sending the JSON (it's a security risk)
LOG IN THIS USER
"req.logIn()" is a Passport method that calls "serializeUser()"
(that saves the USER ID in the session)

//NOTE JWT tokens
JWT used to require that certain endpoints 
havea valid JWT in their request 
google and facebool modules are used 
to provide endpoints to authenticate with them
and return a JWT 

//NOTE local startegy explainer 
inside of localStrategy.js we define the strategy 
this one we require inside index.js in Passport
this index.js is used in app.js
which makes that we can use it in our 
auth login route

Authentication mechanisms, 
known as strategies, 
are packaged as individual modules. 
Applications can choose which strategies to employ, 
without creating unnecessary dependencies.

.authenticate is called within route handler 
rather then being used as middleware so we have access
to the res and req objects 

cb can use provided arguments to handle to authentication 
req.login will establish a session 

//NOTE way of getting user info (safer)
way of getting user info thanks to
passport serializer we get it based upon session id
password is already made null in serializer
req.user.password = null
